// EXERCISE: The Fortune Teller

// Why pay a fortune teller when you can just program your fortune yourself?

// Write a function named tellFortune that:
// takes 4 arguments: number of children, partner's name, geographic location, job title.
// outputs your fortune to the screen like so: "You will be a X in Y, and married to Z with N kids."
// Call that function 3 times with 3 different values for the arguments.

var tellFortune = function(number, partner_name, location, job) {
	alert("You will be a " + job +  " in " + location + ' and be married to ' + partner_name + ' with ' + number + ' kids.');
}

tellFortune(3, 'Sam', 'Toronto', 'Developer')

// EXERCISE: The Age Calculator

// Forgot how old you are? Calculate it!

// Write a function named calculateAge that:
// takes 2 arguments: birth year, current year.
// calculates the 2 possible ages based on those years.
// outputs the result to the screen like so: "You are either NN or NN"
// Call the function three times with different sets of values.
// Bonus: Figure out how to get the current year in JavaScript instead of passing it in.

var calculateAge = function(birth_year, current_year) {
	var age = current_year - birth_year;
	alert('You are either ' + age + ' or ' + (age - 1));
}

calculateAge(1991, 2014)

// EXERCISE: The Lifetime Supply Calculator

// Ever wonder how much a "lifetime supply" of your favorite snack is? Wonder no more!

// Write a function named calculateSupply that:
// takes 2 arguments: age, amount per day.
// calculates the amount consumed for rest of the life (based on a constant max age).
// outputs the result to the screen like so: "You will need NN to last you until the ripe old age of X"
// Call that function three times, passing in different values each time.
// Bonus: Accept floating point values for amount per day, and round the result to a round number.

var calculateSupply = function(age, amount_per_day) {
	var maxAge = 100;
	var lifeSpan = (maxAge  - age) * 365;
	var floater = Math.floor(amount_per_day);
	consumption = lifeSpan * floater;

	console.log('You will eat ' + consumption + ' snacks before you die.')
}

calculateSupply(22, 4)
calculateSupply(23, 4)
calculateSupply(27, 10)
// EXERCISE: The Geometrizer

// Create 2 functions that calculate properties of a circle, using the definitions here.

// Create a function called calcCircumfrence:

// Pass the radius to the function.
// Calculate the circumference based on the radius, and output "The circumference is NN".
// Create a function called calcArea:

// Pass the radius to the function.
// Calculate the area based on the radius, and output "The area is NN".

var calcCircumference = function(radius) {
	var circumference = Math.floor((radius * 2) * Math.PI);
	console.log('The circumference of the circle with a radius of ' + radius + ' is approximately ' + circumference);
}

// EXERCISE: The Temperature Converter

// It's hot out! Let's make a converter based on the steps here.

// Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:

// Store a celsius temperature into a variable.
// Convert it to fahrenheit and output "NN째C is NN째F".
// Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:

// Now store a fahrenheit temperature into a variable.
// Convert it to celsius and output "NN째F is NN째C."

var fahrenheitToCelsius = function(fahrenheit) {
	var toC = (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
	console.log(toC);
}

var celsiusToFahrenheit = function(celsius) {
	var toF = (celsius * 9) / 5 + 32;
	console.log(toF);
}
